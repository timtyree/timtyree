Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ 
I am a Ph.D. candidate in my fifth-year in our Dept. of Physics.  I am studying statistical models for the dynamics of spiral defect chaos as it emerges from simulations of pathophysiological cardiac arrhythmia.  I also study Cognitive Neurophysics using electrophysiological recordings from the hippocampus of germ-free marmosets.
