Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ 
I am a physicist.  I am studying statistical models for the dynamics of spiral defect chaos as it emerges from simulations of pathophysiological cardiac arrhythmia.  I also study cognitive neurophysics using electrophysiological recordings from the hippocampus of germ-free marmosets.

I am super-down to apply what I have learned to forecasting the valuation of securities for the gains of my reinforement-learning automata (private!).
